class FileStorageManager(StorageManagerInterface):
	"""
		This class inherits from the StorageManagerInterface ABC and implements it by putting 2-d numpy
		arrays with 64-bit floats for both times and values onto disk. 

		NOTES
		-----
		PRE: It supports access to the time series in memory both on get and store calls by managing 
		a class variable self._id_dict

		Examples:
		---------
		>>> fsm = FileStorageManager()
		>>> ts = ArrayTimeSeries(times=[2,6,11,17,25], values=[10,12,22,34,40])
		>>> unique_id = fsm.get_unique_id()
		>>> fsm.store(unique_id, ts)
		array(...
		>>> stored_ts = fsm.get(unique_id)
		>>> assert stored_ts[2] == 22.0
